## Saving repaid loans on ethereum blockchain

This repo is just a concept. The idea is to save data about repaid loans on ethereum blockchain to have a proof that the loan was really repaid. We save hash from client's passport details, creditor tax identification number and credit document number on the blockchain. Then we can compare hashes, if hash was found then loan was fully repaid.
